# PHP_Project

It's a basic social media application made using php.

For the styling part , I use bootstrap and custom css.

There is an auth system that save name , email and password.

It allows to you post text and see other users posts.

In the index page , there is two option ; you can see everyone's posts in home page or just your posts in your profile.
